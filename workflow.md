# ðŸ“§ Email Workflows & JIRA Alerting Training Daily Diary

## ðŸ“… Week 11 (Days 51-55): Email Systems, Alerting & JIRA Workflows

### Days 51-53: Email Systems, Distribution Lists & Alert Workflows

The first part of the week focused on understanding how email communication works within our organization for security operations. We learned about proper email protocols including when to email different teams, escalation procedures, and communication hierarchies. The instructor explained Distribution Lists (DLs) and their critical role in security alerting - who gets notified for different types of incidents and when.

Key topics covered organizational email structure, security team distribution lists for various alert types, and proper escalation chains. We learned about different DLs such as SOC-L1, SOC-L2, Security-Management, and Emergency-Response, understanding when each should be used based on incident severity and type.

The session progressed to email alert systems and notification workflows, covering the complete alert lifecycle from detection to resolution. We learned structured alert email formats with standardized subject lines and body sections. Key topics included email routing based on severity and asset type, delivery confirmation methods, and backup communication channels.

We practiced configuring email alert templates and learned how email-to-JIRA connectors automatically create tickets by parsing email content and mapping it to JIRA issue structures.

### Days 54-55: JIRA Workflows & SLA Management

The latter part of the week covered comprehensive JIRA workflow management for security incidents. We learned project configuration, user permissions, and integration points with security tools. The instructor demonstrated ticket creation methods including automated creation from emails, manual creation by analysts, and API integration.

We practiced creating tickets for various scenarios like phishing reports, malware detections, and policy violations. The training covered standard workflow states: Open, In Progress, Waiting for Info, Escalated, Resolved, and Closed. Essential ticket fields included incident type, affected assets, severity level, assignment, and evidence links.

The final day focused on Service Level Agreement management and response times for different alert severities:

**SLA Framework:**

- **Critical (15 minutes)** - Immediate phone call, active breaches and system compromises
- **High (30 minutes)** - Phone call within 15 minutes, significant threats requiring urgent attention
- **Medium (45 minutes)** - Email acknowledgment within 15 minutes, moderate security concerns
- **Low (1 hour)** - Email acknowledgment within 30 minutes, minor issues and informational alerts

We learned SLA tracking using JIRA's built-in features and practiced triage methodology, escalation procedures, and communication templates for different severity levels. Practical exercises included classifying incoming alerts, calculating SLA compliance, and developing workflows for managing multiple priority levels.
