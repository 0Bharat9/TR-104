### Days 76-77: Client Onboarding & Harmony Portal Setup

This week began our comprehensive Avanan onboarding training. We learned the initial client onboarding process which starts with scheduling calls with clients to access their Microsoft Office 365 environment through the Avanan Harmony portal.

The instructor demonstrated the complete onboarding workflow - joining client calls, guiding them through the authentication process using their Microsoft O365 credentials, and establishing the initial connection to their email environment. We learned about proper client communication during onboarding and setting appropriate expectations.

We practiced navigating the Harmony portal setup process, understanding the OAuth authentication flow, and ensuring proper permissions are granted for email monitoring. The training emphasized the importance of clear documentation and client coordination during this critical initial phase.

### Days 78-80: Tenant Creation & Monitoring Period Setup

These days focused on creating client tenants within the Avanan portal and configuring the initial monitoring phase. We learned how to properly set up tenant structures that reflect client organizational hierarchies and user management requirements.

The instructor walked us through the process of importing and listing all organizational user accounts under the newly created tenant. We learned about user categorization and how Avanan identifies different types of users during the monitoring period.

We studied the 48-72 hour monitoring period setup, understanding how this phase allows Avanan to identify distribution lists, key organizational personnel, and communication patterns. The training covered monitoring period configuration and what data is collected during this phase to establish baselines for normal email behavior.

We learned about monitoring period best practices, including client communication about the observation phase and setting proper expectations for when active protection will begin.
