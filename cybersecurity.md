# SOC Analyst Industrial Training - Cybersecurity Fundamentals

## üóìÔ∏è Week 3 (Day 11-15): Security Foundations & Frameworks

### Core Security Principles

We began with the fundamental pillars of information security - the CIA triad. Confidentiality ensures information is only accessible to authorized individuals, Integrity guarantees data hasn't been tampered with, and Availability ensures systems and data are accessible when needed. The AAA framework complemented these principles through Authentication (verifying user identity), Authorization (determining user permissions), and Accounting (tracking user actions). In SOC operations, these principles guide access controls, incident handling, and maintaining security tool availability for 24/7 monitoring.

### Risk Management Concepts

I learned to distinguish between risks, threats, and vulnerabilities through practical examples. A vulnerability is a system weakness, a threat is a potential danger that could exploit it, and risk is the probability of successful exploitation. Defense in depth emerged as a critical strategy, implementing multiple security layers rather than relying on single controls. The principle of least privilege ensures users have only minimum required access, reducing the attack surface SOC analysts must monitor.

### Security Frameworks and Standards

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework provided structure through five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. ISO 27001/27002 standards introduced systematic information security management approaches with comprehensive control sets. PCI DSS requirements became relevant for SOC teams supporting organizations handling payment card data. These frameworks guide daily SOC activities from threat identification through incident recovery.

### Legal and Regulatory Compliance

HIPAA regulations emphasized protecting healthcare information, requiring SOC teams to recognize PHI-related incidents and ensure proper breach notifications. GDPR introduced privacy by design principles affecting how SOC teams collect and process security logs, especially from EU residents. SOX compliance focused on financial record accuracy and strong internal controls, requiring SOC monitoring of financial systems. Understanding these regulations helps SOC analysts properly handle compliance-related security events.

### MITRE ATT&CK Framework Deep Dive

The MITRE ATT&CK framework maps adversary behavior through 14 tactics from Initial Access to Exfiltration. Each tactic contains specific techniques adversaries use to achieve objectives, enabling better detection rule creation. Initial Access techniques like phishing and exploit public-facing applications directly impact SOC monitoring strategies. Understanding technique-to-threat-actor mappings enables context-rich threat hunting and incident attribution. The framework transforms abstract threats into concrete indicators SOC analysts can actively hunt for.

### Incident Response Planning

The incident response lifecycle (Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned) provides structured approaches to security events. Preparation involves maintaining updated playbooks and properly configured monitoring tools. Identification requires distinguishing between false positives and genuine security events with quality initial analysis. Containment strategies vary by incident type, requiring SOC analysts to balance immediate risk reduction with evidence preservation. Clear communication protocols and escalation paths ensure timely stakeholder notification during incidents.

### Threat Intelligence Integration

Threat intelligence transforms reactive monitoring into proactive threat hunting through Strategic, Tactical, and Operational intelligence types. Strategic intelligence provides long-term context about adversary motivations, while Tactical offers specific IOCs for detection rules. The Diamond Model connects adversary, capability, infrastructure, and victim relationships to help analyze complex incidents. Intelligence sharing platforms like STIX/TAXII enable collaborative defense, allowing SOC teams to both consume external intelligence and contribute their observations. Proper integration of threat intelligence significantly enhances SOC detection capabilities and incident context.

### Vulnerability Management Principles

The vulnerability lifecycle spans Discovery, Assessment, Remediation, and Verification, with SOC teams contributing context during exploit investigations. CVSS scoring provides standardized risk ratings, but SOC analysts must consider asset criticality and exploitability when prioritizing monitoring efforts. Zero-day vulnerabilities present unique challenges, requiring behavioral analysis and anomaly detection without established signatures. Understanding common exploit patterns helps identify potential zero-day attacks through unusual system behavior. SOC teams must balance vulnerability exposure awareness with practical monitoring limitations.

### Human Factor Security

Social engineering attacks target human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities, requiring SOC analysts to recognize campaign indicators. Phishing remains a primary attack vector, demanding constant monitoring of email security solutions and suspicious message analysis. Security awareness programs need measurement and monitoring, with SOC teams providing incident metrics to identify training gaps. Understanding psychological manipulation techniques helps assess social engineering campaign sophistication. SOC teams must integrate human-focused threat detection with traditional technical monitoring.

### Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery

Business impact analysis (BIA) helps prioritize systems for protection and recovery, influencing SOC containment decisions during incidents. Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) define acceptable downtime and data loss tolerances. Crisis management extends beyond technical response to include communications and stakeholder management. SOC teams provide technical input for crisis decisions while maintaining operational focus. Understanding business priorities ensures appropriate incident response escalation and resource allocation.

### Governance and Risk Management

Information security governance establishes frameworks guiding SOC operations, including reporting structures and risk tolerance levels. Risk assessment methodologies provide structured threat and vulnerability evaluation approaches. Security metrics like MTTD, MTTR, and false positive rates measure SOC performance and effectiveness. Third-party risk management recognizes organizational security dependencies on vendor practices. Regular metric analysis helps optimize SOC operations and demonstrate value to organizational leadership.
