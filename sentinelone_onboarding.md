# üõ°Ô∏è SentinelOne Onboarding

## üìÖ Week 14 (Days 66-70): SentinelOne Agent Management & Deployment

### Days 66-67: SentinelOne Agent Installation Fundamentals

This week began our deep dive into SentinelOne onboarding processes. We learned about SentinelOne agent architecture and deployment strategies across different operating systems. The instructor covered agent installation procedures for Windows, Linux, and macOS environments.

We studied the agent installation process including system requirements, network connectivity prerequisites, and proper installation verification methods. The training emphasized understanding client environment assessment before agent deployment and ensuring compatibility with existing security tools.

Key topics included agent communication protocols, cloud connectivity requirements, and initial agent registration processes. We learned about deployment planning and scheduling considerations for large-scale client onboarding projects.

### Days 68-70: Cross-Platform Deployment & Package Management

These days focused on hands-on agent deployment across multiple platforms. We practiced installing SentinelOne agents on Windows systems using MSI packages, Linux installations using RPM and DEB packages, and macOS installations using PKG files.

We learned about different package types and their deployment scenarios. The instructor explained General Availability (GA) packages for stable production deployments and Early Access (EA) packages for testing new features and capabilities. Understanding when to use each package type was crucial for proper client onboarding.

The training covered deployment methods including manual installation, group policy deployment for Windows environments, and automated deployment tools for Linux and macOS systems. We practiced verifying successful installations and troubleshooting common deployment issues across different operating systems.

## üìÖ Week 15 (Days 71-75): Site Management & Migration Processes

### Days 71-72: Site and Group Structure Management

These days covered SentinelOne organizational structure including sites and groups management. We learned how to create sites for different client locations or business units and configure groups within sites for granular management.

The instructor walked us through site creation procedures, group configuration, and hierarchical management structures. We practiced setting up organizational structures that align with client business requirements and security policies.

We learned about policy inheritance from sites to groups and how to configure appropriate settings for different organizational units. The training emphasized proper planning of site and group structures during initial client onboarding to ensure scalable management.

### Days 73-74: Migration Processes & Policy Configuration

This part focused on migration processes - moving devices between tenants, sites, and groups. We learned step-by-step migration procedures and understanding when migrations are necessary during client transitions or organizational changes.

The instructor demonstrated device migration from one tenant to another, site-to-site migrations, and group-to-group transfers. We practiced using migration tools and understanding the impact on device policies and historical data during migration processes.

We also covered policy and configuration management for different sites and groups. This included setting up appropriate security policies, scan configurations, and behavioral settings based on client requirements and risk profiles.

### Day 75: Whitelisting, Blacklisting & Exception Management

The final day focused on creating whitelists and blacklists for client environments. We learned about application whitelisting to allow trusted software and blacklisting to block known malicious or unwanted applications.

The training covered different types of exclusions including file exclusions, folder exclusions, process exclusions, and network exclusions. We practiced creating exclusion policies based on client application requirements and business needs.

We learned about hash-based exclusions, certificate-based exclusions, and path-based exclusions. The instructor emphasized the importance of proper documentation and regular review of exclusion lists to maintain security effectiveness while minimizing false positives.

The session included troubleshooting common issues with exclusions and understanding the security implications of different exclusion types during client onboarding processes.
