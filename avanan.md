# ðŸ“§ Avanan Email Security Training Daily Diary

## ðŸ“… Day 41-42: Fundamentals of Email Security

Our training began with a comprehensive overview of modern email security challenges. The instructor emphasized how email continues to be the primary attack vector for cybercriminals, with over 90% of cyberattacks beginning with a phishing email. We learned the fundamental concepts that form the backbone of email security:

- **Phishing** - We studied the evolution from basic phishing to sophisticated spear phishing, business email compromise (BEC), and executive impersonation attacks.
- **Spam** - The instructor differentiated between harmless bulk emails and malicious spam containing malware or phishing links.
- **Email Authentication Standards** - We deep-dived into the critical email authentication protocols:
  - **SPF (Sender Policy Framework)** - How it verifies sender IP addresses against published DNS records
  - **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)** - The cryptographic verification method for email integrity
  - **DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)** - How it ties SPF and DKIM together with explicit policies

The second day focused on the limitations of traditional secure email gateways (SEGs). The instructor explained how these perimeter-based solutions often miss threats like account takeover, internal email threats, and advanced phishing that doesn't contain traditional indicators of compromise. We learned why API-based security that sits behind the native security of cloud email providers offers significant advantages over traditional gateway approaches.

## ðŸ“… Day 43-45: Deep Dive into Avanan Architecture

During these three days, we explored Avanan's unique approach to email security. Unlike traditional SEGs that sit in front of the email flow, Avanan connects via API to scan emails after they've been delivered but before they reach user inboxes. The instructor highlighted this as a key differentiator, allowing Avanan to:

- See emails after they pass Microsoft/Google's native security
- Operate without changing MX records
- Scan internal email traffic, not just inbound messages
- Provide post-delivery protection through continuous scanning

We learned about Avanan's cross-tenant intelligence and how it analyzes communication patterns to detect anomalies. The instructor walked us through the platform's integration capabilities with various cloud applications:

- **Email Platforms**: Microsoft 365, Gmail
- **File Sharing**: OneDrive, SharePoint, Google Drive, Dropbox, Box
- **Communication Tools**: Microsoft Teams, Slack
- **Additional Services**: Citrix ShareFile

A significant portion focused on Avanan's multi-layer detection engines:

- **AI-Based Detection** - Pattern recognition for zero-day threats
- **Anti-Phishing** - NLP and computer vision to detect sophisticated phishing
- **Malware/URL Scanning** - Sandboxing and real-time URL inspection
- **Anti-Evasion** - Detecting techniques used to bypass security measures
- **Behavioral Analysis** - Identifying unusual user or email behaviors
- **Brand Impersonation** - Logo detection and domain similarity checking

## ðŸ“… Day 46-48: Avanan Console Navigation & Threat Management

These days were dedicated to mastering the Avanan management console. We began with the Security Overview dashboard, learning to interpret the summary widgets showing threat distributions across Phishing, BEC, Malware, and DLP categories.

The instructor guided us through each main section of the platform:

- **Overview Tab** - Interpreting threat summaries and trends at a glance
- **Events Tab** - Where we learned to analyze incidents by state, severity, and by SaaS application
- **Mail Explorer Tab** - Deep email investigation capabilities with advanced search filters for sophisticated threat hunting
- **User Interaction Tab** - Managing phishing reports and quarantine restore requests from end users

We practiced investigating different security events in the Events section, where we could filter threats by multiple criteria including state, severity, threat type, remediation status, and action taken. The instructor demonstrated how to analyze typical incidents including:

- Malware attachments quarantined by Microsoft
- User-reported phishing emails
- Shadow IT alerts for unapproved SaaS applications

In the Mail Explorer section, we learned how to conduct detailed searches using the advanced filtering capabilities. The instructor showed us how to trace email flows, examine headers, and analyze message content for indicators of compromise.

## ðŸ“… Day 49-50: Incident Response & SOC Operations

The final two days focused on practical SOC operations and incident handling using real-world scenarios. We worked with the Avanan Console to generate and analyze security incident reports for various threat categories:

- **Anomaly Detection** - We reviewed suspicious login activity alerts, analyzing IP source information, geolocation data, and performing validation workflows. We practiced triaging user authentications from unusual locations and determining whether activities were legitimate or potential security incidents.

- **Shadow IT Detection** - We worked with reports identifying unauthorized software usage within the organization, particularly focusing on cloud services accessed via email. We evaluated incidents where employees were using third-party applications like Calendly without formal IT approval.

For each incident type, we practiced the complete SOC workflow:

- Initial alert review and categorization
- Threat intelligence enrichment
- Validation and verification steps
- Recommended remediation actions
- Response documentation

We applied a structured approach to report-writing, following the standardized format used by SafeAeon's SOC team which includes:

- Incident details section with concise technical information
- Analysis comments with key findings
- Verification steps that must be taken
- Clear, actionable remediation recommendations

The training concluded with best practices for security operations:

- Creating efficient investigation workflows for SOC analysts
- Establishing clear procedures for managing false positives
- Integrating Avanan alerts with SIEM and ticketing systems
- Effective security metrics reporting for management
